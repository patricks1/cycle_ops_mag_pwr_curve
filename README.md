This code fits a third-order polynomial to CycleOps' Mag power curve. I got the power curve from [https://cycleops.com/post/blog-15-cycleops-science-resistance-curves](https://cycleops.com/post/blog-15-cycleops-science-resistance-curves).

See `result.png` for the resulting parameters and plot.
See `results.txt` for a text version of the fitted parameters to higher decimal precision.
