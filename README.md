This code fits a third-order polynomial to CycleOps' Mag power curve. I got the power curve from [https://cycleops.com/post/blog-15-cycleops-science-resistance-curves](https://cycleops.com/post/blog-15-cycleops-science-resistance-curves). PowerCurve Sensor data comes from [http://www.powercurvesensor.com/cycling-trainer-power-curves](http://www.powercurvesensor.com/cycling-trainer-power-curves)

See `result_kph.png` and `result_mph.png` for the resulting parameters and plot.  
See `result_kph.txt` and `result_mph.txt` for a text version of the fitted parameters to higher decimal precision.
